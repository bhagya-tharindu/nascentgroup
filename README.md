The technology stack used to create this project includes Next.js for the framework, Tailwind CSS for styling, React Icons for incorporating icons, and React Hot Toast for displaying toast messages.

With more time, I could have added animation effects using Framer Motion and enhanced the styling to make the UI more attractive.
